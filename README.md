# ML Model Deployment
<hr>
<p>
  This project is part of my internship program in <a href = "https://feynnlabs.com/">FeyNN Lab</a>. Here I have built a model with the help of XGBoost algorithm to predict the heart disease. Here I have created a HTML page to deploy this model. See the HTML Preview (below).
